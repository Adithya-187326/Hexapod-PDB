# Introduction
This shield was designed as part of a hexapod robot to be a central controller board that operates on high currents to control 18 servos around an Arduino MEGA microcontroller development board. The working sections of the printed circuit board are broken down into the following areas:
- Power Distribution
- Arduino MEGA Development Breakout Section
- NRF24L01 Connect Provision
